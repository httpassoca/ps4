# Playstation 4

When the PS4 launch I couldn't buy it so I stayed wondering how the PS4 UI was. I had some idea by Youtube gameplays and pics from my friends but never had seen everything. Now, 7 years later, I bought my Ps4 XD and thought that simulate it on web would be cool for those who have the same curiosity I had. Also its good to use the Ps4 flow without FPS drops ðŸ˜†

- Vite + Svelte + SASS

Development paused because I am tired of searching a way to use svelte components integrated with animejs
